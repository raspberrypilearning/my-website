  + The music you like
  + A hobby you enjoy
  + A cause you care about

### Why are you making the website?

--- task ---

Think about the purpose of your website.

### Plan your website

--- task ---

Think about the topic you have chosen, the project brief, and the HTML and CSS you have learned from the previous projects in [this pathway](#). What kinds of pages would help people learn about that topic? Can you write a short introduction to it, find some pictures, and maybe a YouTube video, that will help them understand your chosen topic?
