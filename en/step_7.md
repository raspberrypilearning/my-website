## Upgrade your project

If you have time you can upgrade your project. You might have ideas to add more already or you might want to go back to the first step and look at other projects again for more inspiration.

You could:
  + Add some more pages to your site (but don't forget to update the menu on every page to link to them!). Consider things like:
    + Including a photo gallery
    + Adding a YouTube video
  + Use CSS to make the pages you already have look even better
    + Change fonts
    + Add colour
    + Add borders to images, or `div`s
