## Introduction

You are going to create a website to teach visitors about something that you think is important. Your website will need to meet the **project brief**.

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
A <span style="color: #0faeb0">project brief</span> describes what a project must do. It's a bit like being given a mission to complete.

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 200px; flex-grow: 1">

### Try it

This is a website that does what the project brief asks for. Yours doesn't have to look like this â€” you can choose your own colours, have more or fewer pages, a different design, or even include video.

### PROJECT BRIEF: [I am bad at names]
<hr style="border-top: 2px solid black;">

Create a website that helps people learn about something you think is important, or interesting.

Your website should:
+ Use a template to have a common style across pages
+ Include a menu to let visitors navigate your website
+ Have at least one page with a few paragraphs of text on it
+ Have a different page with some images on it

Your website could:
+ Include a video from YouTube
+ Include a list
+ Have more than two pages
</div>

### Get inspiration

--- task ---

Think about what you want your site to be about, and what kinds of pages would be best for sharing that, as you investigate these example projects to get more ideas:

**Recepie collection**: A collection of links and videos of recepies the creator loves to cook.
