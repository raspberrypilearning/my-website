## Make some pages

Now that your template is ready, create at least two pages based on it.

--- task ---

Create a homepage to introduce your site. Make sure the file is named `index.html`, as that is the first page browsers will look for when loading a website. Don't add any code to the file just yet.

--- /task ---

Next, you'll need another page. It could be a anything you want, but here are a few ideas:

  + A list of tour dates, if the site is about a band, or game dates for a sports team.
  + A gallery of photographs.
  + A collection of quotes from someone related to the subject of the site.
  + A tutorial for visitors on how to do something, if you site is about a skill or hobby.
  + A collection of useful links.

Create another page and name the file. Again, don't add any code to it yet.

--- task ---

Go back to `template.html` and add the two pages you just created to your menu.

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Copy all the code from `template.html` and paste it into your new pages.
